# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report a security problem in a public issue, pull request or
forum post.

Report it privately through GitHub instead: open the **Security** tab of this
repository, then **Report a vulnerability**.

No such button? Private reporting is not enabled yet: open an issue that only
asks the maintainers for a private contact, without any detail of the problem,
and send the report there.

Include, when you can:

- the version of the integration and of Gladys;
- what an attacker can do, and the steps to reproduce it;
- the log lines that help (remove tokens, passwords and addresses first).

The fix ships as a new version of the integration, and the advisory is
published once users can update.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives security fixes: update the integration from
Gladys before reporting a problem.

## Scope

In scope: the code of this repository and the Docker image it publishes.

The integration stores nothing in `/data` and holds no secret: it reads three
public APIs without a key (api-lannuaire.service-public.fr, geo.api.gouv.fr
and, when a place is chosen, data.strasbourg.eu) over HTTPS, with a timeout and a size cap on every answer, and
only asks the directory for the fields it needs (never the names of the heads
of services). It opens no port and talks to nothing on the local network.

Out of scope: Gladys Assistant itself (see its
[security policy](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys/security/policy)),
and the third-party services and devices the integration talks to.
